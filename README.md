Product Recommendation System for E-commerce Project
Project Background
This project focuses on enhancing product recommendations and understanding market trends for an online retail platform. A SQL-based data warehouse was designed to store and manage customer and sales data. The project involved analyzing 10,000 customer records, forecasting sales trends, and building personalized recommendation systems using Python to improve user experience. These insights help businesses identify profitable segments and optimize marketing efforts, leading to growth and increased customer satisfaction.

Dataset Structure
The dataset for this project was organized into a SQL-based data warehouse with multiple tables for customer data, sales records, product information, and regional market data. The primary data structure used for this analysis and modeling is the combination of two major sources:

Superstore Data: Superstore purchase history and revenue data.

Superstore Reviews Data: Rating, review and summary of the product given by the customer.

Note: The dataset comprised 10,000+ records, divided into 36 columns, the feature-target description you can see here.

Executive Summary
This project implemented a SQL-based Superstore Data Warehouse and developed product recommendation models to improve customer experience and sales strategies. By analyzing data from 10,000 customers, the system identified profitable market segments, forecasted sales trends, and provided personalized product recommendations.
Key insights included the dominance of the "Consumer" segment in profitability, the significant role of California as the top-performing market, and strategies for improvement in underperforming regions such as North Dakota.
